# matlabseismic

A comprehensive MATLAB codebase for seismic analysis and processing, developed during my studies at China University of Geosciences, Beijing (CUGB). This repository contains:

- Custom seismic processing functions developed to meet course requirements
- Complete homework solutions organized by chapter in separate branches
- Modernized implementations with fixes for MATLAB version compatibility issues

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/littlepenguin66/matlabseismic.git
cd matlabseismic
git checkout ch02  # Replace with desired chapter (ch02, ch03, etc.)
```

2. Open and run scripts in MATLAB
3. Explore and modify the code for your needs
